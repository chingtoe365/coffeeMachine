This solution contains three projects - REST API service, integration test, and a client app, with the correspondence to the folders as follows

API - CoffeeMachine
Test - CoffeeMachineUnitTest
Client - CoffeeMachineCli

API and integration test can be run standalone, as they read and write different DBs where the DB files locates in their own root dir separately.

Client app cannot be run standlone and API should be launched beforehand. In Visual Studio, you can change via "Set startup project" when you right-click the solution in solution explorer.
