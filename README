/ * Solution overview */

This solution contains three projects - REST API service, integration test, and a client app, with the correspondence to the folders as follows

API - CoffeeMachine
Test - CoffeeMachineUnitTest
Client - CoffeeMachineCli

API and integration test can be run standalone, as they read and write different DBs where the DB files locates in their own root dir separately.

Client app cannot be run standlone and API should be launched beforehand. In Visual Studio, you can change via "Set startup project" when you right-click the solution in solution explorer.

..*API - C#/.NET WCF service
DB - SQLlite3
Test - VB built-in test tools
Client - Node.JS

/* API usage */

Once API service is up and running, the following endpoints are available:

a) Get last order detail

curl -X GET http://localhost:62431/api/Order

b) Place new order and verify by step a) again

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"Drink\": \"coffee\", \"SugarAmount\": \"20\", \"OwnMug\": \"1\"}" -X POST http://localhost:62431/api/Order
